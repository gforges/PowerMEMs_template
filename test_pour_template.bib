	abstract = {In order to raise student awareness on the importance of academic writing, we worked with undergraduate students who were studying the inal semester of the BA during a C1 European framework French class. The task assigned was to write up the irst draft of a publishable article on the same topic as their dissertation, for publication in a journal of language teaching and learning. The paper reports on the intervention mode in the classroom, following pedagogical principles of a research paper writing process in the mother tongue and a foreign language. We also discuss the students’ reactions to the intervention and the dificulties encountered when writing the article, and in academic writing in general; all this in order to improve the eficiency of future pedagogical interventions.},
